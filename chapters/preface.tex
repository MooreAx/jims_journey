\chapter{Preface}

I was moved to write this biography by comments made by my grandson Alex after he viewed some slides and heard Deanna and I relate some favorite family stories. His remarks:” Grandpa you just have to write this stuff down or else it will be lost after you pass on”. Also, there seems to be a resurgence of interest in family history encouraged in part by the internet which has tools to help with family history searches, family photo storage, genealogical information, etc. So Alex, with thanks to you, I share these stories and remembrances from days gone by.
